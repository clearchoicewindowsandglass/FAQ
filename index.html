  <h1>Clear Choice FAQ</h1>
  
  <div id="faq">
    <h3>When will I receive my Quote?</h3>
    <p>We try our best to send your quote within 24 hours of the estimate (Excluding Thursday Estimates). Some quotes can take longer than others but we will keep you updated. </p>

    <h3>What should I do if I don't receive my quote within 24 hours?</h3>
    <p>If it has been more than 24 hours since your estimate and we have not notified you of a delay in your estimate, please check your spam folder. If the estimate is not in your spam, please give us a call or email; sometimes we have the incorrect email address. </p>
 
    <h3>Is sales tax included?</h3>
<p>Sales tax is included in the price we send you. (Impact products currently have no sales tax)</p>

<h3>How long will it take to get my windows installed?</h3>
<p>Lead time varies; as of now, 7/06/23, it will be approximately four months from the day you place your order to the day we are there to do the install.</p>

<h3>Do you offer any discounts?</h3>
<p>We do not offer any discounts. We give our best price upfront.</p>

<h3>What if I get a quote that is cheaper than yours?</h3>
   <p>Make sure you are comparing apples to apples. If the difference is within $500, chances are we have included the permit cost and/or engineering and the competition has not (we see this all of the time). If at the end of the day, your two quotes are for exactly the same thing, but we are still more expensive, don't be shocked. All of our employees and installers are highly trained and equipped to give you the best service and installation possible. We stand behind our product and installation and are confident that the value of working with us will far exceed whatever the monetary difference may be. </p>

   <h3>What if I get a quote that is more expensive than yours?</h3>
  <p>Celebrate! You are not only getting the best installation in town but you're getting it at a better rate than anyone else is offering! </p>
 
  <h3>What brands of windows do you work with?</h3>
<p>We work directly with PGT as we are PGT dealers. We have worked with several companies in the past and now only work with PGT due to the great quality and amazing warranties they offer.</p>

<h3>What is the next step after receiving my quote if I want to move forward?</h3>
<p>The next step would be to reach out to us and schedule a final. The final consists of us coming back out to get final measurements (measure twice cut once). We will also have you sign the contact, NOC and permit application to pull your permit. The final is also the time we will collect the deposit.</p>

<h3>How much is the deposit?</h3>
<p>The deposit is 50% of your total order. We will collect 50% upfront. The remaining 50% is due after your job is completed.</p>

<h3>If you have any questions at all please email us or give the office a call 772-217-2990! (Maybe it'll get added to this list!)</h3>
